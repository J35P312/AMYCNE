The following folder contains examples on how the different functions of AMYCNE may be used.

These examples was also used for benchmarking AMYCNE in the AMYCNE paper.

The AMY_genotyping folder contains instructions on how to compute the copy number of AMY1, AMY2A and AMY2B

The delly_filtering folder contain instructions on how to filter the delly deletion vcf using copy number information of the annotation module.

Lastly, the NA12878_calling folder contains scripts for variant calling on the NA12878 sample, and how to compare these results to CNVnator calls.

The NA12878 sample was used to benchmark AMYCNE. the NA12878 bam file may be downloaded through this link

There is also a tab file available in the coverage folder inside the delly_filtering folder, uncompress this file to test AMYCNE.
